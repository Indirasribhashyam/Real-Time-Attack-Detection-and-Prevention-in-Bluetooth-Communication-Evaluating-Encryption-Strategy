# Real-Time-Attack-Detection-and-Prevention-in-Bluetooth-Communication-Evaluating-Encryption-Strategy
Bluetooth communication faces growing security threats such as Man-in-the-Middle (MitM), DDoS, and device spoofing due to vulnerabilities in pairing, encryption, and authentication.

## Abstract

This research proposes a lightweight Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model to detect attacks and compares five lightweight encryption algorithms—ChaCha20, AES-CCM, Ascon, PRESENT, and SPARX—for secure Bluetooth communication in resource-constrained devices. A real-time monitoring system is also implemented to block suspicious devices based on request frequency.

## Problem Statement

Resource-constrained edge devices like the ESP32 are vulnerable to Bluetooth attacks exploiting weak protocols and encryption. Existing solutions either lack detection accuracy or are too heavy for embedded systems. This project addresses these issues by combining a GCN-based attack detection model with a comparative analysis of efficient lightweight encryption algorithms, alongside real-time anomaly detection to provide robust and efficient Bluetooth security for IoT applications.
